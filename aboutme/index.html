    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Gabriel Bolivar</h2>
    <h2>Ga</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone,
        I am from La Paz Bolivia. I am working as a Customer service agent for a company in The US. <br>
        I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied technology because I know I can get better job opportunities <br> 
        in other countries, even when I am here in Bolivia. <br>

        This is my family, we took this picture before my sister went to the mission. <br>
        <img src="images/proposal.JPG" alt="photo of my porposal"> <br>
        I do not take photos often, but here is one... It was a few weeks ago when I propose my girlfriend. <br>
        She is studying French, so I decide to put "marry me" on that language, we will get married by the end of the year.</p>
